The dataset consists of several health-related attributes of individuals. These attributes include the number of times the individual has been pregnant, the plasma glucose concentration two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skin fold thickness, 2-hour serum insulin level, body mass index (BMI), diabetes pedigree function (a score based on family history indicating the likelihood of diabetes), age in years, and an outcome variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes. The "Pregnancies," "Glucose," "BloodPressure," "SkinThickness," and "Insulin" attributes are all represented as integers, while "BMI," "DiabetesPedigreeFunction," and "Age" are represented as floating-point numbers. This dataset is commonly used in machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the onset of diabetes based on these health-related features.
